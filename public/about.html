        <p>
            TRUSÆL is the company that is reinventing the business of how 60% of the world's wealth is traded, representing $20 trillion of real estate transactions every year. TRUSÆL combines technology, real estate and marketing into one innovative company. TRUSÆL
            uses the existing infrastructure of a dying industry that is ripe for an overhaul, to revolutionize and modernize the real estate business. We have created an online marketplace where real estate agents compete against each other by bidding
            to represent buyers and sellers in transactions. Since we have are one of the first business models of this kind, there will be little competition and TRUSÆL will have the opportunity for substantial market share. If the company is able to
            maintain similar market share to Uber as we grow, TRUSÆL will have annual revenues of $42B CAD just from trading real estate, plus additional revenue from any paid services offered. That's great, fantastic... and we're all about being the
            best and making money but, not at the unfair expense of our clients.
        </p>

        <p class="text-center">
